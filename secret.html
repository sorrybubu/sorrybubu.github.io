  <p>
    I know I hurt you.  
    I know I made you feel unheard, unimportant, or taken for granted.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn’t me asking for forgiveness immediately.  
    This is me taking responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    You mean more to me than I’ve shown,  
    and I hate that it took distance or pain to make that clear.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m sorry—for the moments I failed you,  
    and for the times I should’ve chosen you better.

    I don’t expect anything.  
    I just wanted you to know that my feelings are real,
    and so is my regret.
